Hi there, I'm Priya Srivastava! 👋 

This website is like my online garden where I play with ideas and share what I've learned. If you're curious, you can check out the [projects](/projects) I've worked on, and if you want to learn something new, there's a [blog](/blog) with helpful tutorials and notes on [books](/books).
I'm really into this idea of learning together, so I keep track of what I'm learning and share it openly. Don't hesitate to connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/priyasrivastava730) if you want to chat or connect – I'm always excited to meet fellow enthusiasts like you!
