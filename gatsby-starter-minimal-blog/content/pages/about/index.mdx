Hi there, I'm Priya SrivastavaðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer, dedicated to crafting projects that enhance user experiences. As an electrical engineer ðŸŽ“, I immersed myself in coding to gain a deep understanding of the intricate mechanisms behind apps and websites. I developed a profound appreciation for how seemingly simple elements like buttons and the satisfaction of green ticks after successful payments can profoundly enhance the user experience.
